# The project
The purpose of this project is to create an online webpage where you can plan your vacations and journeys in an imaginary galaxy.

The app can create a route through the galaxy from start point to endpoint, and calculate travel and lodging prices, along with events that you may want to include in your package.
 
 The project uses .NET API's to distribute data to a separate frontend, and Entity Framework to handle changes to an in memory database.
